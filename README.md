# 🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to the Breast Cancer Prediction project! This repository showcases a machine learning solution to classify breast cancer tumors as **benign** or **malignant** using various classification algorithms. Our goal is to aid early diagnosis and potentially save lives. 💡🎗️

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this project, we applied several supervised machine learning algorithms to the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset** to build an effective prediction model. The models were evaluated based on their accuracy, and the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model outperformed others with an accuracy of **97%**. 🏆📈

## 🧠 Applied Machine Learning Models

- 🌳 Decision Tree (DT)
- 📈 Logistic Regression (LG)
- 🌀 Support Vector Machine (SVM) — **Best accuracy: 97%**
- 🧪 Naive Bayes (NB)
- 🌲 Random Forest (RF)

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29)
- **Attributes**: 30 real-valued input features computed from a digitized image of a breast mass.
- **Target**: Diagnosis (Malignant = 1, Benign = 0)

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- 🐍 **Python** — Core programming language
- 🧮 **NumPy, Pandas** — Data processing & analysis
- 📊 **Matplotlib, Seaborn** — Visualization
- 🧠 **Scikit-learn** — Machine learning models and utilities
- 💻 **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** — IDE for development
- 📂 **Git & GitHub** — Version control & collaboration

## 📌 Key Features

- End-to-end ML pipeline: preprocessing, training, testing, and evaluation.
- Visual comparison of model performances.
- Easy-to-read and modifiable code for learning and extension.
